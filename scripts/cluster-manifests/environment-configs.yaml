# Crossplane Environment Configurations
# Purpose: Platform-wide shared configuration accessible to all Compositions
# Restaurant Analogy: The "house recipes and standards" - shared ingredients and settings
#
# EnvironmentConfigs provide a way to share configuration across all templates
# without hardcoding values. Compositions can load these using the
# function-environment-configs in their pipeline.
