  - Measured from template selection to running service
  - Includes all automation steps (Git repo, CI/CD, deployment)
  
- **✅ Successful provisioning rate**: > 95%
  - Percentage of provisioning requests that complete without errors
  - Excludes user-cancelled requests

### Platform Adoption
- **📦 Number of available templates**: 10+
  - Production-ready service templates
  - Covering different technology stacks (Node.js, Go, Python, etc.)
  - Including infrastructure components (databases, queues, etc.)

- **👥 Active users**: Track monthly active developers
  - Unique users creating or managing services
  - Growth rate month-over-month

### Developer Experience
- **😊 Developer satisfaction**: > 4/5
  - Quarterly developer survey
  - Net Promoter Score (NPS)
  - Time saved vs. traditional provisioning

- **📚 Documentation coverage**: 100%
  - All templates have complete documentation
  - All APIs documented with examples
  - TechDocs integrated for all services

### Operational Excellence
- **🔄 Mean time to recovery (MTTR)**: < 1 hour
  - For platform issues
  - Automated rollback capabilities

- **📈 Platform availability**: > 99.9%
  - Uptime for portal and provisioning services
  - Excluding planned maintenance

## 📝 How We Measure

### Automated Metrics
- **Provisioning time**: GitHub Actions workflow duration
- **Success rate**: GitHub Actions success/failure ratio
- **Platform availability**: Uptime monitoring (e.g., Pingdom, UptimeRobot)
- **Active users**: GitHub API analytics

### Manual Metrics
- **Developer satisfaction**: Quarterly surveys via Google Forms
- **Documentation coverage**: Manual audit checklist
- **Template quality**: Peer review process

## 🏆 Success Criteria

- 80% of developers prefer it over manual provisioning
- No critical security incidents

### Target Success
- All success metrics achieved
- Platform adopted as standard for new services
- Positive ROI demonstrated (time saved × developer cost)

### Stretch Goals
- External teams requesting access
- Contributing templates back to community
- Speaking at conferences about the platform

## 📊 Reporting

### Weekly
- Provisioning success rate
- Number of services created
- Active templates

### Monthly
- All KPIs dashboard
